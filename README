To run this system you need to have mysql and a server running for the database. I used xampp to run the system which you can easily download. I used mainly java, css, and sql
Run the sql from the 'student.sql' file after creating a database called studentmanager_db.
Note: You can change the name of the database in the class DatabaseConfig.java.
      You also need to navigate to this folder to set up any changes to the database URL in order to run this properly.

	The app.java is essentially the index file in this case.

The user will be able to register, and also login.
